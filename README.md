Data sonification - possibly a better representation of meteorological data, and a new idea for music composition.

To all data scientists: we know that data can be visualized, but have you ever wondered if data can be represented aurally? To all musicians: are you looking for new inspirations of your compositions? To coding enthusiasts: want to try using some Music Algorithms in your works?

Our project provides a new way to encode meteorological data into musical notes
